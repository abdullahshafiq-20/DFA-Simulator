## Features ✨

- **Canvas Visualization**: The application features a central canvas area where you can create and manipulate DFA states through intuitive interactions. 🖼️
- **State Creation**: Double-click on the canvas to create new states for your DFA. 🆕
- **Transition Definition**: Connect states by drawing transitions between them and define the corresponding input values. ➡️
- **String Testing**: Test your DFA by providing input strings to see their acceptance or rejection. 🔍
- **Manual Debugging**: Step through the DFA manually, exploring state transitions with specific inputs for a deeper understanding. 🐞
- **Example DFAs**: Access pre-defined examples to learn and experiment with different DFA configurations. 📚
- **Intuitive Interface**: The user-friendly interface makes it easy to navigate and interact with the DFA Simulator. 🖥️
